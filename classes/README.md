# Classes

## [Outline](outline.md)

+ The term "class" refers to all classes, interfaces, and traits
+ A class should only ever be autoloaded - never use `require` or `include`

## [Members](members.md)

+ Constants should only be declared on a class
+ Constants should use `UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORED`
+ Properties should use `$camelCase`
+ Classes should have all or no static members

## [Methods](methods.md)

+ Methods should use `camelCase()`
+ All parameters should define their type where possible
+ All methods should define their return type where possible
+ Methods should avoid becoming longer than 20-50 lines
+ Public functions should show the headlines of a class's functionality
