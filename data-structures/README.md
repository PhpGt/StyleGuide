# Data structures

## [Arrays](arrays.md)

+ Data structures representing collections should be array-accessible and/or iterable
+ Data structures representing individual items should use getter functions
+ Associative arrays should only be used for simple key-value-pairs
+ Use built-in functions rather than operators to manipulate array contents

## [Class methods](class-methods.md)

+ Static classes should only be used when truly stateless
+ Private methods should be preferred over anonymous functions where appropriate
+ Anonymous functions should never exceed 5-10 lines
