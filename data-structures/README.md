# Data structures

## [Associative arrays](associative-arrays.md)

+ Data structures representing collections should be array-accessible
+ Data structures representing individual items should be property-accessible
+ Associative arrays should only be used for simple key-value-pairs
+ Move associative arrays to an object's getter/setter storage where possible

## [Class methods](class-methods.md)

+ Static classes should only be used when truly stateless
+ Private methods should be preferred over anonymous functions where appropriate
+ Anonymous functions should never exceed 5-10 lines
