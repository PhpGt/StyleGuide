# Brackets and braces

## [Opening and closing braces](opening-closing-braces.md)

+ Opening braces should always be placed at the end of the line
+ Closing braces should always be placed at the start of their own line

## [Brace indentation](brace-indentation.md)

+ One level of indentation should be applied within, and only within, the braces
+ Conditionals within brackets should not gain extra indentation when breaking onto separate lines
+ Never leave conditional statements unbraced or unindented
